Expert systems resolve rule base conflicts using a process called conflict resolution or conflict management. This involves determining which rule should be applied when multiple rules are applicable to a given situation. There are several methods used in conflict resolution, including:

1. **Weighting**: Each rule is assigned a weight, which represents its importance or reliability. The rule with the highest weight is applied.

2. **Ordering**: Rules are ordered in a specific sequence, and the first rule that matches the current situation is applied.

3. **Hybrid approach**: This combines weighting and ordering methods, allowing for more flexibility in resolving conflicts.

4. **User preference**: In some cases, the user is given the option to manually select which rule to apply when there is a conflict.
